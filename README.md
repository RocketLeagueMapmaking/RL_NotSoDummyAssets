# RL_NotSoDummyAssets

This is a repository of Rocket League .upk file which have been decrypted with a method that generates simplfied versions of the models and textures, allowing for an easier experience when using them to build a map.

Because these files contain actual mesh and image data, they are several orders of magnitude larger than the [Dummy Assets versions](https://github.com/RocketLeagueMapmaking/RL_DummyAssets).
